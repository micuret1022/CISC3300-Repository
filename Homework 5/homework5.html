<!--1. Create a variable via a ternary operator that assigns a string based on an expression--> 

<script>
    const age = 21;
    const status = age >= 18 ? 'adult' : 'minor';
    console.log(status);
</script>

<!--2. Create an object and loop through its properties, console logging each properties’ value-->

<script>
    const person = {
        name: 'Jeff',
        age: 25,
        city: 'Detroit'
    };

    for (let key in person) {
        console.log(person[key]);
    }
</script>

<!--3. Create an array of numbers. Using the map function, create a second array of those numbers squared-->

<script>
    const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * num);
    console.log(squaredNumbers); //Output: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
</script>

<!--4. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree?-->
<!-- The DOM (Document Object Model) specifies how browsers create a model of an HTML page and 
    how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
    The DOM tree is a hierarchial representation of the elements in an HTML document, where each node represents
    an element and attributes, and the relationships between elements are depicted through parent-child relationships.-->

<!--5. What is a XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?-->
<!-- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. 
     It allows attackers in input malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal 
     sensitive data. There are different ways to guard against these attacks, such as 1) be very careful with 
     what content you treat as html  2) It should very rarely have the option to have come from a user at all  
     3) If it is necessary there are options to validate that input, strip it of potential malicious intent by 
     removing tags, escaping charachters, etc... -->

<!--6a. Add a button with an id, when that button is clicked, change the button’s text-->

<button id="myButton" onclick="changeText()">Click Me!</button>
<script>
    function changeText() {
        document.getElementById('myButton').innerText = 'Button Clicked';
    }
</script>

<!--6b. Add a list with several list items, if any list item is clicked, change all list items color to blue-->

<ul id="myList">
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Rabbit</li>
    <li>Snake</li>
    <li>Hamster</li>
</ul>
<script>
    const listItems = document.querySelectorAll('#myList li');
    listItems.forEach(item => {
        item.addEventListener('click', () => {
            listItems.forEach(li => {
                li.style.color = 'blue';
            });
        });
    });
</script>

<!--6c. Add a div that contains a second button element. When that button element is clicked, append a paragraph element with some text to the containing div after the second button.-->

<div id="myDiv">
    <button id="secondButton">Click me</button>
</div>
<script>
    const div = document.getElementById('myDiv');
    const button = document.getElementById('secondButton');

    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
