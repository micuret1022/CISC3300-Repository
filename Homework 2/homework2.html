<!-- 1. Structural elements refer to the way HTML elements organize the content on the page and provide a basic structure for the document. For example, <header>, <main>,and <footer> all provide a clear structural layout for the web page. Semantic elements go beyond the structure and try to convey the meaning of the content. The semantic elements consist of information about the type of content inside of them. For example, <article>, <section>, and <figure> all add semantic meaning to the web page. 

    2. It’s important to use correct html elements when designing web pages for reasons that include accessibility, consistency, search engine optimization (SEO), and readability. Using the correct html elements increases accessibility for users, especially those with disabilities. Correct elements also allow for a consistent and maintainable codebase, which allows developers to more easily collaborate with each other. Search engines also rely on proper structure of HTML to understand the content correctly. 

    3. Forms in HTML are used to collect user input. They allow users to enter data, such as phone numbers, emails, and feedback. Common form elements include: <form>, <select>, <button>, and <textarea>. The <form> element encapsulates all of the other form elements. Forms can be used for many different purposes, such as user authentication, data submission, or surveys.

    4. 4. Inline elements do not start on a new line; they continue within the content and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include, <span>, <a>, and <em>. Block elements always start on a new line and extend to the full width available which forces a new block of content.  Examples of block elements include, <div>, <p>, and <h1>.
