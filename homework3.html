    3. Margin, Padding, and Boarder are fundamental concepts of the CSS box model. Each one serves a distinct role in controlling the layout and spacing of elements on a webpage. Margin is the space outside the boarder of an HTML element. It defines the distance between the element's boarder and and adjacent elements in the layout. Margins are used to create spacing around an element, controlling its positioning in relation to the other elements that are on the webpage. A boarder is the visible line that surrounds the content and padding of an HTML element; it defines the outer edge of the element. Boarders create a visual boundary for the element, some of its properties include width, color, and style. Padding is the space between the content of an HTML element and its boarder. It affects the internal spacing within the element. Padding is used to control the distance between the content and the element's boarder, which influences the element's size and appearance. Margin, boarder, and padding all collectivly influence the spacing and appearance of HTML elements on a webpage. While this is true, it is important to note that each property addresses a different part of the webpages appearance.
